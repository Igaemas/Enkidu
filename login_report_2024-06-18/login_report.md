## Code Analysis

### Pseudo C Code

#### main.c
```c
/* WARNING: Function: __x86.get_pc_thunk.bx replaced with injection: get_pc_thunk_bx */

undefined4 main(void)

{
  int comparisonResult;
  char passwordInput[6];
  int isAuthenticated;
  undefined *stackPointer;
  
  stackPointer = &stack0x00000004;
  isAuthenticated = 0;
  puts("Enter admin password: ");
  gets(passwordInput);
  comparisonResult = strcmp(passwordInput,"pass");
  if (comparisonResult == 0) {
    puts("Correct Password!");
    isAuthenticated = 1;
  }
  else {
    puts("Incorrect Password!");
  }
  if (isAuthenticated == 0) {
    printf("Failed to log in as Admin (authorised=%d) :(\n",0);
  }
  else {
    printf("Successfully logged in as Admin (authorised=%d) :)\n",isAuthenticated);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

#### Description
The provided code prompts the user to enter an admin password, reads the input using gets, and then compares it with the string "pass" to determine if the entered password is correct. If the password matches, it prints a success message and sets the isAuthenticated variable to 1. Otherwise, it prints a failure message. The value of isAuthenticated is then used to print whether the login was successful or not.

The primary security issue with this code is the use of the gets function to read the password input. The gets function does not perform bounds checking and is therefore susceptible to buffer overflow attacks, where an attacker could overflow the passwordInput buffer to execute arbitrary code or manipulate the program's execution. This vulnerability can be mitigated by using safer functions like fgets or scanf with a specified limit on input length. Additionally, it is a bad practice to use hardcoded passwords in the code as it can lead to security vulnerabilities if the code is exposed or reverse-engineered. To improve the security of handling passwords, consider using secure password hashing mechanisms and proper password storage strategies.

#### _start.c
```c
Changed code:


/* WARNING: Function: __i686.get_pc_thunk.bx replaced with injection: get_pc_thunk_bx */

void entryPoint _start(undefined4 mainFunc, undefined4 stackSize)

{
  undefined stackMemory [4];
  
  __libc_start_main(main, stackSize, &stack0x00000004, __libc_csu_init, __libc_csu_fini, mainFunc, stackMemory);
  do {
                    /* WARNING: Do nothing block with infinite loop */
  } while(true);
}
```

#### Description
The code initializes a program using the **__libc_start_main** function, which is common in Linux systems to set up the main execution environment and prepare to call the main function. The function **entryPoint** (originally **processEntry**) takes two parameters which were renamed for clarity: **mainFunc** and **stackSize**. The local variable **auStack_4** was renamed to **stackMemory** to reflect more clearly that it represents some allocated stack space. After initialization, the code enters an infinite loop that does nothing.

There are several security considerations with this code, primarily stemming from the use of **undefined** types and the lack of proper error checking which can lead to vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or stack corruption. Additionally, the infinite loop could be a potential point of Denial of Service (DoS) attack if not properly managed. Functions like **__libc_start_main** are generally safe if used correctly, but misuse or erroneous parameters can compromise the programâ€™s security, making robust and secure handling crucial.

#### _init.c
```c
/* WARNING: Function: __x86.get_pc_thunk.bx replaced with injection: get_pc_thunk_bx */

int initialize(EVP_PKEY_CTX *context)

{
  undefined *functionPointer;
  
  functionPointer = PTR___gmon_start___0804bffc;
  if (PTR___gmon_start___0804bffc != (undefined *)0x0) {
    functionPointer = (undefined *)(*(code *)PTR___gmon_start___0804bffc)();
  }
  return (int)functionPointer;
}
```

#### Description
The provided C pseudo code has a function named _init which has been renamed to initialize for better readability. The parameter ctx has been renamed to context for clarity. The variable puVar1 has been renamed functionPointer to give more context as to its role in pointing to a function. 

This code includes a check on a pointer PTR___gmon_start___0804bffc, and if it is not null, it attempts to call the function at that location. One important security consideration here is the dereferencing and indirect call of a function pointer. It is critical to ensure that this pointer points to a legitimate and safe function to avoid arbitrary code execution or corruption. Furthermore, the use of undefined pointers (type undefined *) can be unsafe because it relies on implicit casting, which can lead to undefined behavior if not handled carefully. Proper type definitions and checks should be enforced to mitigate risks. Ensuring that pointers are valid and operations on them are secure is paramount to avoid vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, code injection, and other security issues.

## Exploit

### Fuzzing

Exploit success with this input :

- pass

- login.c

### Buffer Overflow

To determine if a buffer overflow is possible, the process involves injecting progressively larger payloads into the target binary and observing the results. By starting with a small payload and incrementally increasing its size, the goal is to trigger a **segmentation fault**, which indicates a buffer overflow vulnerability. If such a fault occurs, the binary is deemed vulnerable, and the specific payload size at which this happens is noted. This method ensures a systematic approach to identifying potential vulnerabilities within a predefined limit.

The memory of the binary is writable with this offset : 12
